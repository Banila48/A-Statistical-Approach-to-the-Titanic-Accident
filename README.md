### About the Project
The goal of this project is to utilized the dataset provided from Kaggle website to analyze the possible factors that affecting surivability and creating a prediction model for survivability of passengers using variables from the dataset for the Kaggle Titanic Competition

### Personal Motivation for this project
In addition, my personal goal for this projet is to use this project as an application for my university module on Statistics, to make use of the statiscal tools to create inference, analysis through hypothesis testing and finally creating regression models. The Statistical methods I applied are: ANOVA, Chi-Squared Test, Bonferroni Method, Regression Modeling(Logistics & Linear Regression), Ordinal & Nominal Encoding, and Correlation Coefficient.

### Files in Repo
There are 5 files in this repo. 
<br>"Analysis & Prediction for Titanic-Statistical View.ipynb" is the heart of this project with the analysis and codes inside a Jupiter Notebook file.
<br> "ANOVA Test.png" & "Chi-Sqaured Test.png" contains the mathematical notation and formulas that I used for my Bivariate Analysis attained from my university Statistics Module.
<br> "train.csv" is the dataset that I utilised for my analysis. "test.csv" contains the data for the test done for the Kaggle competition.
